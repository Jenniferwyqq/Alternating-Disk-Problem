Alternating disks
# 335-Project-1

Quesiont: You have a row of disks of two colors, light and dark. They alternate: light, dark, 2𝑛 𝑛 𝑛 light, dark, and
so on. You want to get all the dark disks to the left hand end and all the light disks to the right hand end.
The only moves you are allowed to make are those that interchange the positions of two neighboring
disks.

Soving: Using the lawnmower algorithm and the alternate algorithm for solving this puzzle and determine the number of moves it takes.
